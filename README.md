# CalculatorInPython
 A calculator made in python.  

Hello, I'm here to explain this calculator!!

To get started, define your variables with syntax:  
```
<name>: <expression value>
```

Yes, in this calculator, you can set variables.  
Additionally, you also can set functions, with syntax:  
```
fn <name>(<parametrs>) -> <expression value>
```
If the function has more one parameter, separate each with ','.  
Also try make sets!!  
There are two ways to do this:  
With a rule...
```
<name>: {<variable test> | <expression rule>}
```

or with elements list:
```
<name>: [<elements separate by ','>]
```

In additional, exists logic and aritmethic operations:  
* `+`: sum,  
* `-`: subtraction,  
* `*`: multiplication,  
* `/`: division,  
* `%`: rest of the division,  
* `**`: potentiation,  
* `log <term1> <term2>`: logarithm,  
* `and`: and,  
* `or`: or,  
* `in`: checks left in right,  
* `~`: not,  
* `xor`: xor,  
* `=` : equal  
* `<`: minus,  
* `>`: bigger,  


Finally, there are built-in functions:  
* `sum`: sum of terms (init, step, max)
* `abs`: absolute value (value)
* `rad`: convert value of angle to rad (value)
* `sin`, cos and tan: respectively sine cosine and tangent (value)
* `invert`: invert the value (value)
* `sqrt`: calcule the square root of the value (value)
* `root`: calcule the root (base, exponent)
* `sequation1`: calcule the solution for the first degree equation (a,b)
* `sequation2`: calcule the solution for the quadracti equation (a,b,c)

The values of the 'pi' and 'e' were also defined.
