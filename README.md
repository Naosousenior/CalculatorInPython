# CalculatorInPython
 A calculator make in python.

Hello, I'm here to explain this calculator!!

To get started, define your variables with sintax:
    <name>: <expression value>

Yes, in this calculator, you can set variables.
Additionally, you also can set functions, with sintax:
    fn <name>(<parametrs>) -> <expression value>

If the function has more one parameter, separate each with ','.
Also try make conjunts!!
There are two ways to do this:
    With a rule...
    <name>: {<variable test> | <expression rule>}

    or with elements list:
    <name>: [<elements separate by ','>]

In additional, exists logic and aritmethic operations:
    +: sum,
    -: subtraction,
    *: multiplication,
    /: division,
    %: rest of the division,
    **: potentiation,
    log <term1> <term2>: logarithm,
    and: and,
    or: or,
    ~: not,
    xor: xor,
    = : equal
    <: minus,
    >: bigger,

Visit the code to see all operations.

Finally, there are built-in functions:
    sum: sum of terms (init, step, max)
    abs: absolute value (value)
    rad: convert value of angle to rad (value)
    sin, cos and tan: respectively sine cosine and tangent (value)
    invert: invert the value (value)
    sqrt: calcule the square root of the value (value)
    root: calcule the root (base, exponent)
    sequation1: calcule the solution for the first degree equation (a,b)
    sequation2: calcule the solution for the quadracti equation (a,b,c)

The values of the 'pi' and 'e' were also defined.
